# 🎮 Game Launcher App

## Project Overview

The **Game Launcher App** is a Python-based application with a *Graphical User Interface (GUI)* that allows users to:

- Browse and launch built-in mini-games
- Track high scores and leaderboards
- Manage multiple games from a single dashboard


---

## Key Features

- A clean and user‑friendly graphical interface
- Multiple games playable from a single launcher
- Highscore tracking and leaderboard supporting
- Modular code structure, separating UI, game logic, and persistent storage - using a DB also
- Demonstrates Python, GUI frameworks, and event‑driven programming

---

## Motivation

This project was created to combine my interest in game development and application interfaces. I wanted to build a *centralized game platform* where users can launch and play small games while their progress and achievements are tracked. This also helped me enhance skills on *Python*, *software architecture*, and *data handling*.
